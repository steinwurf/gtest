About
=====

We use Google C++ Testing Framework to test most of our libraries.

We use Waf to cross-compile gtest for the different platforms that
we support. We provide the Waf and wscript files needed to build the gtest library.

Dependencies
------------

1. Git: A usable git client installed (see the "Set Up Git" guide at 
   the `github help`_ pages)
2. Python: To use Waf you need to install python version 2.7 and up should
   be fine. 
3. C++ compiler: To build the Boost libraries you need C++ compiler. We have tested with gcc 4.6 (Linux) and Visual Studio 2012 Express (Windows)
